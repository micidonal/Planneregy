**Done So Far**
 - API keys for Firebase, Google Cloud, Open Weather Map updated in secret.js
   
**Need To Do**
 - Locate and adjust API call related code in DataModel.js (Firebase calls), Login.js (Google Cloud calls), and BeforeLoginScreen.js (Open Weather Map calls) to ensure they work properly
     - For Weather Map, info on how to call it and what the outputs look like can be found here: https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3
 - Ensure depreciated packages/imports used in the original project still work and any issues can be adjusted for by adjusting import versions and not the code itself
 - Test the code using Expo ('expo start' or 'npx expo start' depending on imports to local machine) and your iPhone (download ExpoGo from AppStore)
